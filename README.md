# README
## Project Overview
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on understanding unemployment trends in the United States during the year 2021, a period marked by the ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Using microdata from IPUMS USA, we investigate how unemployment distributions vary across states and demographic groups, as well as the influence of factors such as age, race, gender, and education level on employment outcomes.

## Goals of the Project
##### Regional Analysis: 
Identify geographical disparities in unemployment rates across different U.S. states and discuss potential factors contributing to these differences.
##### Demographic Disparities: 
Examine how race, gender, and age correlate with unemployment outcomes, highlighting groups that are disproportionately affected.
##### Education and Employment: 
Investigate the relationship between educational attainment and unemployment, quantifying the protective effect of education during economic instability.
##### Policy Implications: 
Provide insights that can inform policymakers, educators, and employers on strategies to address unemployment disparities and strengthen labor market resilience.
## Contents of the Repository
##### Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:
Code and scripts that load the raw data, clean missing values, remove duplicates, and create derived variables for easier analysis.
##### EDA Notebooks:
Jupyter/R Markdown notebooks containing the exploratory analysis, visualization, and interpretation of results.
##### Data Visualization:
Scripts and code blocks that produce maps, bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps illustrating key trends in the dataset.
##### Statistical Analysis:
Correlation analyses and regression models evaluating the relationship between educational attainment and unemployment.
##### Conclusion & Insights:
Summary of key findings, implications for policy, and suggestions for future research directions.
## How to Use This Repository
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
Set Up Environment:
Install the required R packages before running the analysis notebooks. A sample list of required packages includes:
tidyverse
maps
ggplot2
readr
viridis
dplyr
Use:
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "maps", "ggplot2", "readr", "viridis", "dplyr"))
Run the EDA Notebook:
Open the .Rmd or .ipynb files in RStudio or Jupyter Notebook to reproduce the analysis. Execute code cells in sequence to replicate data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical modeling steps.

## Interpreting Results:
Review plots, charts, and summary tables to understand unemployment distributions by state and demographic factors.
Check correlation outputs and regression summaries to see how strongly education correlates with unemployment rates.
Read the conclusion section to gain insights into policy implications and potential areas for further research.
